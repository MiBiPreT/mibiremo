"""Python interface to PhreeqcRM for geochemical reactive transport modeling.

PhreeqcRM is a reaction module developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
for coupling geochemical calculations with transport models. It provides a
high-performance interface to PHREEQC geochemical modeling capabilities for
reactive transport simulations in environmental and hydrological applications.

PhreeqcRM enables:

- Multi-threaded geochemical calculations for large-scale transport models
- Equilibrium and kinetic geochemical reactions in porous media
- Parallel processing for computationally intensive reactive transport

This interface provides a Python wrapper around the PhreeqcRM C++ library,
simplifying the process of integrating geochemical calculations with transport models.

All RM_* methods in this class correspond directly to PhreeqcRM C++ functions.
PhreeqcRM documentation and source code can be found at:

class PhreeqcRM:
    """Python interface to PhreeqcRM for geochemical reactive transport modeling.

    This class facilitates coupling between transport codes and geochemical
    reaction calculations by managing multiple reaction cells, each representing
    a grid cell in the transport model. The PhreeqcRM approach allows efficient
    parallel processing of geochemical calculations across large spatial domains.

    The class handles:
        - Creation and initialization of PhreeqcRM instances
        - Loading thermodynamic databases (PHREEQC format)
        - Setting up initial chemical conditions from input files
        - Running equilibrium and kinetic geochemical reactions
        - Transferring concentrations between transport and reaction modules
        - Managing porosity, saturation, temperature, and pressure fields
        - Retrieving calculated properties and concentrations

    Typical workflow:
        1. Create instance and call create() method to initialize with grid size
        2. Load thermodynamic database with initialize_phreeqc()
        3. Set initial conditions with run_initial_from_file()
        4. In transport time loop:
           - Transfer concentrations to reaction module with RM_SetConcentrations()
           - Advance time with RM_SetTime() and RM_SetTimeStep()
           - Run reactions with RM_RunCells()
           - Retrieve updated concentrations with RM_GetConcentrations()

    Attributes:
        dllpath (str): Path to the PhreeqcRM dynamic library file.
        nxyz (int): Number of grid cells in the reactive transport model.
        n_threads (int): Number of threads for parallel geochemical processing.
        libc (ctypes.CDLL): Handle to the loaded PhreeqcRM dynamic library.
        id (int): Unique instance identifier returned by RM_Create.
        components (numpy.ndarray): Array of component names for transport.
        species (numpy.ndarray): Array of aqueous species names in the system.

    Note:
        This interface requires the PhreeqcRM dynamic library to be available
        in the [lib/](lib/) subdirectory. The library handles the underlying PHREEQC
        calculations and memory management.

    Examples:
        See folder [examples/](examples/) for usage examples.
